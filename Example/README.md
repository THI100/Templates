Those are only examples of some components in usage which are present in this templates repository.

app and index files, i personally recommend to be as .js files, remembering that the index should always be a .js file!

Note: On the index.js only use the Strictmode and/or App function
Note Help: Importing StrictMode ( import { StrictMode } from "react"; then use inside the root-render (<StrictMode> </StrictMode>) )
